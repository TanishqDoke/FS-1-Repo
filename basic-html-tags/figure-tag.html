    <h1>Html Figure Tag</h1>
    <p>The figure tag specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.
        While the content of the figure element is related to the main flow, its position is independent of the main flow,
        and if removed it should not affect the flow of the document.</p>
